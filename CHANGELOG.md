## 🚀 Latest Updates (December 18, 2025)

### 🤖 AI Coach Webhook Integration - DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS ⚠️
**Status:** Frontend complete and deployed. n8n workflow needs configuration fixes.
**Deployed URL:** https://playbook-dyx.pages.dev/

---

#### 📁 Files Modified This Session:

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/aiChatService.js` | Enhanced error handling with detailed console logging for debugging empty responses |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Comprehensive documentation of n8n debugging session |

#### 🔄 Git Commits:
- `cd7670b` - Improve AI Coach error handling for n8n webhook

---

#### 🐛 Issues Discovered & Diagnosed:

**1. Empty Webhook Response (Content-Length: 0)**
- **Symptom**: curl requests return HTTP 200 but empty body
- **Verified**: Webhook receives requests, AI Agent processes them (visible in n8n Output panel)
- **Root Cause**: "Respond to Webhook" node not returning agent output

**2. Simple Memory "No Session ID" Error**
- **Symptom**: Workflow execution fails with "No session ID found"
- **Cause**: Simple Memory node was set to "Connected Chat Trigger Node" but webhook doesn't send `sessionId`
- **Fix Applied**: Changed to "Define below" with static key `playbook-chat`

**3. Webhook Node Configuration**
- **Verified**: "Respond" parameter correctly set to "Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node"
- **Verified**: Connections are `Webhook → Reranking RAG Agent → Respond to Webhook`

---

#### 🔴 Current Issue:
The n8n workflow still returns empty response. Debugging ongoing to identify why "Respond to Webhook" node returns `Content-Length: 0` even though:
- Webhook triggers correctly
- AI Agent generates output (visible in n8n UI)
- Respond to Webhook is set to "All Incoming Items"

#### 🔧 n8n Workflow Architecture:
```
Webhook (POST)
    ↓
Reranking RAG Agent
    ├── OpenAI Chat Model (gpt-4o-mini)
    ├── Simple Memory (session: playbook-chat)
    ├── Supabase Vector Store - Retrieval
    └── Cohere Reranker
    ↓
Respond to Webhook (All Incoming Items)
```

---

#### 📋 Frontend-to-n8n Communication:

**Request (from frontend):**
```javascript
POST https://fiyasolutions.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/32fad67f-4be9-4670-8abc-d5028304fcd5
Content-Type: application/json

{ "chatInput": "User's message" }
```

**Expected Response (from n8n):**
```json
{ "response": "AI's reply text" }
// or
{ "output": "AI's reply text" }
```

**Frontend handles multiple response formats:**
```javascript
data.response || data.output || data.message || data.text || data.content
```

---

#### 🚀 Deployment:
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Live URL**: https://playbook-dyx.pages.dev/
- **Repo**: https://github.com/Drfiya/Playbook
- **Auto-deploy**: Pushes to `main` branch trigger deployment

---

#### 📂 Debugging Screenshots (not committed):
- `Node-connections.JPG` - Workflow node connections
- `Respond-to-webhook3.JPG` - Respond node showing input data
- `Simple-memory.JPG` - Simple Memory configuration
- Various other debugging screenshots in project root

---

#### 🔨 Next Steps to Complete Integration:
1. Verify n8n workflow executes without errors
2. Confirm "Respond to Webhook" node receives data from AI Agent
3. Test that response body is populated (not empty)
4. Verify CORS headers allow frontend domain
